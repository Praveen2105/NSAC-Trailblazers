# Spot-That-Fire-V3.0-Nasa-Space-Apps-Challenge

[FireAlert Frontend](https://forestfires.co/html/index-2.html)

Our project leverages pioneering AI techniques to detect wildfire at very early stages, way faster than the current systems used.
The system seamlessly detects fire with data from various sources like IoT devices, satellite data and data provided by users living nearby the forest. The usage of different technologies gives us unique advantage and helps detect wildfire faster. Our system also provides great features like smart routing, smart alert system, emergency center finder, and much more to the users in case a wildfire occurs.
